Welcome to the Fisherman's Information Site.

The Fisherman is an important worker for your Colony. As long as you provide the Fisherman with a fishing rod, the Fisherman will provide your Town with everything that can be caught; fish, salmon, pufferfish, clownfish as well as junk and even TREASURE!

Before you choose a place to build his hut, take into account that he has to be near water or that you personally will have to build him a pond close to his hut so he can fish. Click here for full information about the [Fisherman's Hut](../buildings/fisherman) block and using your [Building Tool](../items/buildingtool). Once the hut is placed, the Fisherman will be automatically assigned (or you can manually assign one with the best [Traits](../systems/workerinfo) for a fisherman if you changed this in the settings tab in the [Town Hall's GUI](../../source/buildings/townhall).

You now officially have a "Fisherman!" CONGRATULATIONS!

Now you can give the Fisherman a fishing rod and it will start to fish. Also, you will have to issue the builder the "Build" assignment so he can build the "Fisherman's Hut". Once the builder is done, you can think about upgrading the Fisherman's hut to expand the range at which it can fish as well as having a higher cap level.

**Note**: The Fisherman will require a body of water of a minimum of 7 x 7 x 1 block deep for the Fisherman to be able to work. And it must be near his hut.

**Hint**: You can give the Fisherman an enchanted fishing rod ***(only when the Hut is level 5)*** and reap the benefits of the treasures he/she will be catching for you. Also, the higher the level of the "Fisherman's Hut" is, the higher the level of "loot" he will be fishing out.
