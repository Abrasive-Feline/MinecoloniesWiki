## Installing Minecolonies Mod on your original Minecraft Launcher.

- This process is for installing only the Minecolonies mod in your original Minecraft launcher. You will *not* be able to connect to the **Minecolonies Official 1.12.2 Test Server** due to the server having a balanced variety of other mods as well.

- For connecting to the Official Test Server, install the [Twitch Client](../installation/twitch) or use [MultiMC](../installation/multimc). You can visit the [CurseForge](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/minecolonies-testpack) site for a zip file containing all mods and the versions we are currently using on the Official Test Server, as well as all the appropriate configs, scripts and the server.dat file for our modpack Official Test Server. If all these additional mods, configs, scripts and the server.dat are downloaded and installed manually, you will be able to connect to our Official Test Server. 

- Installation of the MineColonies mod is very simple. It does require Minecraft Forge to be able to integrate mods into the Minecraft game.

*We cannot offer support on the installation of Minecraft Forge. This guide is meant as a general guide for the original Minecraft launcher only for current version 1.12.2 (as of the writing of this post).*

### Download Forge

Go to the [Minecraft Forge Download page](http://files.minecraftforge.net/?forums) and Download the "Recommended" Version.

### Run Forge Installer

Run the downloaded recommended version and make sure it's on "Install Client". Installation path is preset according to Minecraft's standard installation path. If you have it installed in a different directory change the installation directory. When it's done you will see a "Complete" message.

### Download Minecolonies

Go to the [MineColonies CurseForge Download page](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/minecolonies/files) site and download the latest 1.12.2 version of MineColonies.

### Navigate to Mods Folder

On your computer go to the **.minecraft/mods** folder. To be able to find this folder, just click on the start button and in the search box type: *%appdata%* and hit "search". It will open the folder where you can find the **.minecraft** folder. Open this folder and inside you will find the **mods** folder.

### Copy Minecolonies to Mods

Once you are in the **.minecraft/mods** folder, copy the downloaded MineColonies file you downloaded in Step 1 and paste it here. NOTE: DO NOT extract the file if the option appears. Just put the .jar file in here without extracting it's contents.

#### If Adding Pack, Extract it

If you are adding the entire modpack to be able to play on the official server, then un-zip the zip file you got from CurseForge containing all the mod files here

### Run Minecraft and Select Profile

Run your Original Minecraft launcher and make sure you have the **forge** profile loaded and hit Play
