Welcome to the Deliveryman's Information Site.

Before you choose a place to build the Hut, take into account the distances among the other buildings and obstacles like water, trees, caves, mountains, lava sources, etc. After you have selected a place for the Hut, you have to craft the Deliveryman's Hut block in the crafting table and use your [Building Tool](../items/buildingtool) to place the building. Once the Hut is placed, the deliveryman will be automatically assigned (or you can manually assign one with the best "[Traits](../systems/workerinfo)" for deliveryman if you changed this in the setting tab in the [Town Hall's GUI](../../source/buildings/townhall).

Now you will have to issue the builder the "Build" assignment so he can build the "Deliveryman's Hut".

Once the builder is done you can now hire the Deliveryman and it will start to run back and forth from the Warehouse to all the workers huts in your Town. The level of the Deliveryman's Hut will dictate how much materials/tools it will carry to/from Huts - Warehouse - Huts, so if you want it to carry more materials/tools, be sure to upgrade the Deliveryman's Hut.

Also, the higher the level of the hut, the Deliveryman will move faster and faster back and forth (nice leveling perk, right?).

| Building Level | Max Stacks of Materials |
| :------------: | :---------------------: |
| 1              | 1                       |
| 2              | 2                       |
| 3              | 4                       |
| 4              | 5                       |

## Hut GUI

Now you can access the Deliveryman's Hut block (right click on it) and you will see a GUI with different options:

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-sm-12 col-md">
    <img src="../../assets/images/gui/bakergui.png" class="img-fluid mx-auto" alt="Baker GUI">
  </div>
  <div class="col-sm-12 col-md">
    <br>
    <p>The Worker assigned and it's Level. (The worker levels up in time by working. The higher the level, the faster and more efficient it will be). And the buttons:</p>
    <ul>
      {% for item in site.data.gui.global %}
        <li><strong>{{ item.button }}:</strong> {{ item.content }}</li>
      {% endfor %}
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>


**Hint**: You MUST build the [Warehouse](../../source/buildings/warehouse) to at least level 1 so the Deliveryman can do it's work. The deliveryman will visit 1 worker's hut per trip then back to Warehouse. So, level up the Warehouse and build more Deliverymen huts to take care of more worker's huts at the same time and grow grow grow... faster faster faster!
