Welcome to the Smeltery Information Site.

Before you choose a place to build the Smeltery, take into account the location from Mine, Warehouse and/or other Worker(s). After you have selected a place for the Hut, you have to craft the Smeltery's Hut block and place it with your [Building Tool](../items/buildingtool). Once the hut block is placed, the Smelter will be automatically assigned (or you can manually assign one with the best  [Traits](../systems/workerinfo) for Smelter if you changed this in the settings tab in the [Town Hall's GUI](../../source/buildings/townhall).

Now you will have to issue the builder the “Build” assignment so it can build the “Smeltery’s Hut”. Once the builder is done you can now hire the Smelter and it will start to process all the block ores that your Miner(s) are mining and turn them into ingots or blocks for all your Towns needs.

**Hint:** Once the builder is done you will want to upgrade the Smeltery to get all the awesome perks it has to offer for higher levels. The higher the level of the Hut the more furnaces the Smelter will be able to use and it will have a higher chance to double and even triple the ingot output per block of ore. The way it works is that the *Worker level* determines the "Chance" is has to either Double or Triple the ingot output of the ores, according to the Hut level. So:


| Building Level | Normal Output | % of Doubling Output | % of Tripling Output | Furnace(s) |
| :-----: | :-----: | :-----: | :-----: | :-----: |
| 1 | 100% | Worker Level Chance | --- | 1 |
| 2 | 100% | 2 x Worker Level Chance | --- | 2 |
| 3 | --- | 100% | --- | 3 |
| 4 | --- | 100% | Worker Level Chance | 4 |
| 5 | --- | 100% | Worker Level Chance | 5 |


## Hut GUI

When accessing the Smeltery's Hut block (right clicking on it), you will see a GUI with different options:

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-sm-12 col-md">
    <img src="../../assets/images/gui/smelterygui.png" class="img-fluid mx-auto" alt="Smeltery GUI">
  </div>
  <div class="col-sm-12 col-md">
    <p>The Worker assigned and it's Level. (The worker levels up in time by doing it's work. The higher the level the faster and more efficient it will be). And the buttons:</p>
    <ul>
      {% for item in site.data.gui.global %}
        <li><strong>{{ item.button }}:</strong> {{ item.content }}</li>
      {% endfor %}
    </ul>
  </div>
