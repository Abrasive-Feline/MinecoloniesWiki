Welcome to the Lumberjack’s Information Site.

The Lumberjack is one of the most essential workers. It will harvest trees to provide the wood for all your Town's needs. It will look for nearby trees and chop them down. It will also plant a sapling in it's place again, of the same variety he just chopped down (provided that the tree dropped saplings and/or you provide the Lumberjack with the appropriate saplings). The lumberjack will only plant a sapling AFTER chopping down a tree, if there are no trees nearby, he will NOT plant any saplings to create a tree.

Before you choose a place to build the hut, take into account that it has to be near trees or that you personally will have to plant trees close to the hut so the lumberjack can work.Click here for full information about the [Sawmill](../../source/buildings/sawmill) block and using your [Building Tool](../items/buildingtool). Once the Hut is placed, the Lumberjack will be automatically assigned (or you can manually assign one with the best "[Traits](../systems/workerinfo)" for Lumberjack if you changed this in the settings tab in the [Town Hall's GUI](../../source/buildings/townhall).

You now officially have a "Lumberjack!" **CONGRATULATIONS!**

Now you can give the Lumberjack an axe and it will start to look for trees to chop down right away.

Also you will have to issue the builder the “Build” assignment so it can build the “Lumberjack's Hut”.

**Note:** Once the builder is done, you can think about upgrading the Lumberjack’s hut to expand the range at which it looks for trees.

**Hint:** You can give the Lumberjack an enchanted axe and reap the benefits of the speed that it will be chopping down trees for your Town's needs. Also you can remove any trees/saplings and replant any type of sapling in any pattern or shape you need to create your perfect grove, for easier access and less walking around, which means more chop chop... ;p
