Welcome to the Guard’s Information Site.

The Guard is the protecting force for your Town. As long as you provide the Guard with a bow and/or a sword (depending on what mode you have set it to), the Guard will protect your Town day and night. Your Guard will also take and use armour you place in the Tower's Hut inventory or in the Guards own inventory.

Click here for full information about the [Guard Tower](../buildings/guardtower) or [Barracks](../buildings/barracks) block and using your [Building Tool](../items/buildingtool). Once the Hut is placed, the Guard will be automatically assigned (or you can manually assign one with the best [Traits](../systems/workerinfo) for Guard if you changed this in the settings tab in the [Town Hall's GUI](../../source/buildings/townhall).

You now officially have a Guard, **CONGRATULATIONS!**

Now you will have to issue the builder the “Build” assignment so it can build the “Farmer’s Hut”. Once the builder is done you can now give the Guard a Sword or a Bow (depending on what mode you have set it to) and the Guard will start to guard or patrol your Town visiting all your nearby worker huts. The level of the Guard's Tower will dictate how far it can patrol, so if you want a longer patrol range, be sure to upgrade the Guard's Tower.

**Hint:** You can give the Guard an enchanted bow, enchanted sword and enchanted armor ***(only when Tower is level 5)*** as well and reap the benefits of the protection thye'll be able to provide and the drops the Guard will be picking up along the way.
